    "description": "This dataset shows:\n\nEmployment rate age 16 to 64 \n - the proportion of people aged between 16 and 64 years in paid work or who had a job that they were temporarily away from (official statistics in development) \n\nEconomic inactivity rate age 16 to 64 \n - the proportion of people aged between 16 and 64 years who are not in employment but do not meet the internationally accepted definition of unemployment because they have not been seeking work within the last four weeks or they are unable to start work in the next two weeks (official statistics in development) \n\n In Great Britain (Northern Ireland national figure included), for periods 2004 to 2023.\n\n### Coverage \n\nGB (England, Wales and Scotland). Northern Ireland national figure included.\n\n### Geography definition\n\nLocal Authority Districts and Unitary Authorities, \nCounties, \nCombined Authorities, \nRegions, \nNations (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland), \nCountries (UK, GB, England and Wales)\n\n### Source\n\n - Great Britain: [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/regionallabourmarket/previousReleases) \n\nData is also available on [NOMIS](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/query/construct/summary.asp?mode=construct&version=0&dataset=17) \n\n\n### Source Notes and Caveats \nCalculation of employment rate: number of employed people aged 16 to 64 years divided by the population aged 16 to 64 years. Population is the sum of employed plus unemployed plus inactive. \n\nCalculation of economic inactivity rate: number of economically inactive people aged 16 to 64 years divided by the population aged 16 to 64 years. Population is the sum of employed plus unemployed plus inactive.\n\nThe ongoing challenges with response rates, response levels and weighting approach mean that labour market statistics based on both the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Annual Population Survey (APS) will be considered [official statistics in development](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/policies/official-statistics-policies/official-statistics-in-development/) until further review. Because of increased volatility of LFS and APS estimates, estimates of change should be treated with additional caution. \n\n\n\n### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format \nThis dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). \nFor example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. \nFor more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).",
