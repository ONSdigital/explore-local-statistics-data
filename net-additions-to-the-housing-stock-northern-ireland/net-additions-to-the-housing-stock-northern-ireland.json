        "caveats": "In line with The Rates (Northern Ireland) Order 1977, Housing Stock is defined as a count of properties which are valued as domestic or mixed for the purposes of rating. This refers to properties in the Valuation List which are used for the purposes of a private dwelling. This excludes caravans, domestic garages, domestic stores and car parking spaces.\n\nPrivate refers to a self-contained dwelling and not the ownership or build type of the dwelling. Housing Stock includes both social sector and private sector dwellings in the Valuation List.\n\nFigures produced by each UK nation may differ due to differing sources, time periods, age analysed or differences in methodologies so they are not directly comparable.",
