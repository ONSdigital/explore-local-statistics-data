This excludes caravans, domestic garages, domestic stores and car parking spaces.\n\nPrivate refers to a self-contained dwelling and not the ownership or build type of the dwelling. Housing Stock includes both social sector and private sector dwellings in the Valuation List.\n\nFigures produced by each UK nation may differ due to differing sources, time periods, age analysed or differences in methodologies so they are not directly comparable.",
