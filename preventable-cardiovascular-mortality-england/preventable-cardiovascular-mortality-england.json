      "caveats": "Population estimates produced by the Office for National Statistics for mid-2022 have been revised, to account for updated estimates of international migration for England and Wales. Data for all geographies covering the 2022 period have been revised to use the revised population estimates. The resultant revisions to rates are very small and do not introduce any meaningful changes to results previously presented. \n\nThis indicator covers the period since March 2020 and includes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
