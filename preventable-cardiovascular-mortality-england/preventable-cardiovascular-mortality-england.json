      "caveats": "Population estimates produced by the Office for National Statistics for mid-2022 and mid-2023 have been revised, to account for updated estimates of international migration for England and Wales. Data for England, regions and local authorities covering the 2022 and 2023 period have been revised to use the revised population estimates. The resultant revisions to rates are very small and do not introduce any meaningful changes to results previously presented.\n\nThis indicator covers the period since March 2020 and includes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe data source combines the City of London totals with Hackney, and the Isles of Scilly totals with Cornwall to prevent potential disclosure of individuals. Explore Local Statistics cannot visualise data for combined areas so please refer to the original data source for this data.",
