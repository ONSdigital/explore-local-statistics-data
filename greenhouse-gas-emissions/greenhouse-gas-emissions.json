The result is expressed in tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) per person.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions here include territorial emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O).\n\nEmissions are reported against the areas where they occurred except for emissions associated with energy supply that are distributed to the areas based on where the 'end-use' of the energy occurred and emissions from waste that have been distributed based on the waste arising in each area.\n\nEmissions data is from UK local authority greenhouse gas emissions estimates where some emissions can't be fully allocated to individual local authorities for technical or disclosure reasons. \n\nSome of this data has been aggregated and may show differences to other published figures.\n\nEmissions data is also visualised on [Local Authority Greenhouse Gas Map.](https://naei.energysecurity.gov.uk/laghgapp/) \n\n\n",
