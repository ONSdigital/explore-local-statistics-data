    "description": "This dataset shows modelled-based estimates for the proportion of economically active people aged 16 years and over without a job who have been actively seeking work within the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks, in Great Britain, for periods 10/2004-09/2005 to 10/2022-09/2023.\n\n### Coverage \n\nGB (England, Wales and Scotland)\n\n#### Geography definition\n\nLocal Authority Districts and Unitary Authorities,\nCombined Authorities,\nRegions,\nNations (England, Wales, Scotland),\nCountries (GB, England and Wales) \n\n### Source\n\n - Great Britain: [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/regionallabourmarket/previousReleases) \n\nData is also available on [NOMIS](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/datasets/umb) \n\n\n### Source Notes and Caveats \nUnemployment rates are calculated as a percentage of aged 16 years and over economically active population. \n\nAs unemployed form a small percentage of the population, the Annual Population Survey (APS) unemployment estimates within local authorities are based on very small samples so for many areas are unreliable. To overcome this model-based estimates have been developed that provide better estimates of total unemployed for local authorities. \n\nThe model-based estimate improves on the APS estimate by borrowing strength from the claimant count to produce an estimate that is more precise i.e. has a smaller confidence interval. The claimant count is not itself a measure of unemployment but is strongly correlated with unemployment, and, as it is an administrative count, is known without sampling error. The gain in precision is greatest for areas with smaller sample sizes. \n\nRefer to the [user guide (pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/labour-market/subnational-labour/model-based-estimates-of-ilo-unemployment-for-lad-uas-in-great-britain---guide-for-users.pdf) for further details. \n\n\n\n### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format \nThis dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). \nFor example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. \nFor more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).",
