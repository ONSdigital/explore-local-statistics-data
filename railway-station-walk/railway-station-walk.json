This analysis contains the locations of 2,808 rail stations in England and Wales in June 2024. Some stations within the National Public Transport Access Nodes (NaPTAN) dataset have been excluded from this analysis. For example, stations on heritage lines that have a seasonal service and stations having a parliamentary service.\n\nAnalysis parameters, including walking speed of 4.8 kilometres per hour, closely follow those of the [Department for Transport Journey Time Statistics (2019)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/journey-time-statistics-guidance/journey-time-statistics-notes-and-definitions-2019#model-params).\n\nPlease see the ['More quality and methodology information'](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/wellbeing/bulletins/accesstolocalamenitiesinenglandandwales/october2024#data-sources-and-quality) section of the publication for further details.",
