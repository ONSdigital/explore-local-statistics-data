It is standard procedure to revise the annual population estimates once new census data becomes available. The population estimates for mid-2022 will be added to the time series, alongside revised figures for mid-2011 to mid-2021, later in 2024.\n- Figures produced by each UK nation may differ due to differing sources, time periods, age analysed or differences in methodologies so they are not directly comparable.",
