        "caveats": "Geography is based upon the home postcode of the learner.\n\nFrom 2013/14 to 2017/18, Modern Apprenticeship (MA) data was reported by Scottish Vocational Qualification (SVQ) level (2, 3, 4 and 5). From 2018/19, SDS began to phase out reporting by SVQ level to instead report by the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) levels. Therefore from 2018/19, any data relating to MA starts is reported by SCQF level only, with residual data including both SVQ and SCQF levels. Please refer back to the Modern Apprenticeship Statistics [user guide](https://www.skillsdevelopmentscotland.co.uk/media/qp3jhkdz/modern-apprenticeship-user-guide.pdf) for more information.\n\nThe [Scotland population time series data](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/publications/population-estimates-time-series-data/) is used to create a rate per 100,000 population and are currently available for the years up to mid-2023.\n\nFigures produced by each UK nation may differ due to differing sources, time periods, age analysed or differences in methodologies so they are not directly comparable."
