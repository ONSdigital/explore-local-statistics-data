Explore Local Statistics cannot visualise data for combined areas so please refer to the original data source for this data. \n\n Impact of Covid: Usually 95% of the state sector pupils are covered by these data. Coverage reduced in 2019/20 to 75% and further in 2020/21 to around 10%. As a result completeness is low especially in 2020/21 when few Local Authorities can be published. By 2021/22 coverage, at 92%, was almost back to normal levels. Further information is available from the data supplier.",
