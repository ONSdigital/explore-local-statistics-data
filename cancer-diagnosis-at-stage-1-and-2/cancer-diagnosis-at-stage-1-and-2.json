They were excluded on the basis that their inclusion would compromise the statistical robustness of the measure.\n\nThe data source combines the Isles of Scilly totals with Cornwall to prevent potential disclosure of individuals. Explore Local Statistics cannot visualise data for combined areas so please refer to the original data source for this data.",
