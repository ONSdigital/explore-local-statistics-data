      "caveats": "Mortgage Product Sales Data (PSD001) is regulatory data reported to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) by regulated mortgage lenders.\n\nThis data reflects the number of mortgages taken out by first-time buyers, either individually or jointly, but does not include first-time buyers who purchased a property without a mortgage.\n\nThe first-time buyer indicator in the FCA data is reported by the mortgage providers and its definition may vary across firms. For example, for individuals who are not remortgaging but have previously owned a property may or may not be counted as first-time buyers. Additionally, if a mortgage is taken out jointly by one first-time buyer and one non-first-time buyer, it may or may not be counted as a first-time buyer.\n\nThe dwelling stock estimates used are published by MHCLG, Welsh Government, Scottish Government and the Northern Ireland Department of Finance.\n\nSome of this data has been aggregated and may differ from other published figures. Data for the Isles of Scilly is unavailable for all years due to low counts. Mortgage sales for Isles of Scilly have been excluded from aggregated areas that would normally include data from this area.",
