            "description": "This dataset shows the count of business births, deaths, actives, and high growth businesses, in the UK, for 2017 to 2022.\n\n### Coverage \n\nUK \n\n### Geography definition\n\n Local Authority Districts and Unitary Authorities, \nEnglish counties, \nRegions, \nNations (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland), \nCountries (UK, GB, England and Wales)\n\n### Source\n\n - United Kingdom: [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/bulletins/businessdemography/previousReleases)\n\n\n### Source Notes and Caveats \n\n- A birth is identified as a business that was present in year t, but did not exist in year t-1 or t-2. Births are identified by making comparison of annual active population files and identifying those present in the latest file, but not the two previous ones. \n- A death is defined as a business that was on the active file in year t, but was no longer present in the active file in t+1 and t+2. In order to provide an early estimate of deaths, an adjustment has been made to the latest two years deaths to allow for reactivations. These figures are provisional and subject to revision.\n- The starting point for demography is the concept of a population of active businesses in a reference year (t). These are defined as businesses that had either turnover or employment at any time during the reference period. Births and deaths are then identified by comparing active populations for different years.\n- High growth businesses are measured by an average growth in employment of greater than 20%, per annum, over a three-year period.",
