      "caveats": "The ongoing challenges with response rates, response levels and weighting approach mean that labour market statistics based on both the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Annual Population Survey (APS) will be considered [official statistics in development](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/policies/official-statistics-policies/official-statistics-in-development/) until further review. Because of increased volatility of LFS and APS estimates, estimates of change should be treated with additional caution.\n\nUpdates to this indicator have been temporarily suspended until the APS reweighting is implemented in 2026.\n\nPlease note that this indicator previously used National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) level 3+ qualifications data but has been updated to the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) level 3+ qualifications data.",
