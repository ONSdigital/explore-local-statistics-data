A device can have a number of connectors of varying speeds.\n\n- There may be notable large reductions seen at local authority level in these statistics when comparing to a previous quarter. This is sometimes caused by a delay between when chargepoint operators decommission older devices in an area and when this information is reported in the source Zapmap data. Reductions caused by this often occur while chargepoint operators move their data reporting onto the open chargepoint interface to comply with the public chargepoint regulations, resulting in more accurate reporting.\n\n- The most recent population figures by Local Authority are sourced from the Office for National Statistics Population estimates for mid-year 2022. For quarters from July 2020 (2020-07) to April 2021 (2021-04), the population figures were sourced from 2019 estimates. Prior to July 2020 (2020-07), the population figures were sourced from the 2018 estimates.",
