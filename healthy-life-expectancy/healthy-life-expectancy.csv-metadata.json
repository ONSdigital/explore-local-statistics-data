The decline in sample size of the Annual Population Survey has impaired our ability to continue using the previous method to estimate age-specific prevalence of \"good\" general health by local authority. We therefore used logistic regression to estimate \"good\" health prevalence instead of using the survey's observed prevalence. This enables continuity in local area reporting with a viable, comparable time series. ONS is currently conducting a review of data sources to assess their future potential to provide robust, reliable and durable measures of health status.\n\nFigures are based on the number of deaths registered, mid-year population estimates, and health state prevalence aggregated over three consecutive years. Figures exclude deaths of non-residents.\n\nEstimates for Isles of Scilly and City of London are excluded because of insufficient population counts.\n\nEstimates for Northern Ireland’s local government districts are available only from 2014 to 2016 onward.\n\nThese estimates of healthy life expectancy in Northern Ireland use different methods and data sources compared to those produced by the Northern Ireland Department of Health; please see their [Health inequalities annual report](https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/news/health-inequalities-annual-report-2025) for more information.\n\nMore quality and methodology information on strengths, limitations, appropriate uses, and how the data were created is available in the [Health state life expectancies, UK quality and methodology information (QMI) report](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/methodologies/healthstatelifeexpectanciesukqmi2020to2022).",
