    "description": "This dataset shows the age-standardised mortality rate from circulatory diseases considered preventable for those aged under 75 per 100,000 population, in England, for three-year rolling periods 2001-2003 to 2021-2023.\n\n### Coverage \n\nEngland\n\n#### Geography definition\n\nLocal Authority Districts and Unitary Authorities,\nCounties,\nRegions,\nNation (England) \n\n### Source\n\n - England: [Office for Health Improvement and Disparities](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/public-health-outcomes-framework/data#page/4/gid/1000044/pat/159/par/K02000001/ati/15/are/E92000001/iid/93722/age/163/sex/4/cat/-1/ctp/-1/yrr/3/cid/4/tbm/1/page-options/car-do-0) \n\n\n### Source Notes and Caveats \n- Population estimates produced by the Office for National Statistics for mid-2022 have been revised, to account for updated estimates of international migration for England and Wales. Data for all geographies covering the 2022 period have been revised to use the revised population estimates. The resultant revisions to rates are very small and do not introduce any meaningful changes to results previously presented. \n- Values for Cornwall and Isles of Scilly are in a combined code (E67000002). Values for Hackney and City of London are in a combined code (E67000001).\n\n\n\n### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format \nThis dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). \nFor example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. \nFor more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).",
