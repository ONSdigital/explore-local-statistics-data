          - Comment: Percentage of pupils in state-funded primary, state funded secondary and special schools that were persistently absent (those absent for 10% of schooling sessions) during the academic year, England (state-funded schools), academic years 2006/07 - 2023/24.
          - Description: This dataset shows the percentage of pupils in state-funded primary, state funded secondary and special schools that were persistently absent (those absent for 10% of schooling sessions) during the academic year, in England (state-funded schools), for academic years 2006/07 - 2023/24. 
		
		### Coverage 
		
		England (state-funded primary and secondary schools, and special schools)
		
		#### Geography definition
		
		Counties and Unitary Authorities,
		Regions,
		Nation (England)
		
		### Source
		
		 - England: [Department for Education](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/pupil-absence-in-schools-in-england#) 
		
		
		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		- Data is not available for academic year 2019/20.
		- Total includes state-funded primary, secondary and special schools. Data for special schools is available from 2016/17 to present. 
		- Sessions recorded as not attending due to COVID circumstances are included as possible sessions in 2020/21 and 2021/22 only, but not as an absence within absence rates.
		
		
		
		### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format 
		This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). 
		For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. 
		For more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).
