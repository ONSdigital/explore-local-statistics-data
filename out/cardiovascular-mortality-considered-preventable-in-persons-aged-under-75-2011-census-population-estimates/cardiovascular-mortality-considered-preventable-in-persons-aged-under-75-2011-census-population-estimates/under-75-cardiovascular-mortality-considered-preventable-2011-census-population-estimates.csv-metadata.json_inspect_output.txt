		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		The data included in this time series are based on 2011 Census mid-year population estimates and therefore should not be used to make comparisons with the published 2021 data, which are based on Census 2021 mid-year population estimates.  
		Values for Cornwall and Isles of Scilly are in a combined code (E67000002). Values for Hackney and City of London are in a combined code (E67000001). 
		
		
		
		### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format 
		This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). 
		For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. 
		For more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).
