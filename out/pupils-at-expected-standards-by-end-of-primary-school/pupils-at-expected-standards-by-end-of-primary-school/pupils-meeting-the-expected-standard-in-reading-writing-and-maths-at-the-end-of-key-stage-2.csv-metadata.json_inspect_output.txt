          - Description: This dataset shows the percentage of pupils in state-funded schools meeting the expected standard in reading, writing and maths at the end of key stage 2, in England state-funded schools, for academic years 2018/19 - 2023/24.
		
		### Coverage 
		
		England (state-funded schools)
		
		#### Geography definition
		
		Local Authority Districts, 
		Counties and Unitary Authorities,
		Combined Authorities, 
		Regions,
		Nation (England)
		
		### Source
		
		 - England: [Department for Education](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/key-stage-2-attainment) 
		
		
		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		- 'State-funded schools' includes LA maintained schools, sponsored academies, converter academies, free schools and state-funded special schools (including hospital schools).
		- Data is not available for 2019/20 and 2020/21 academic years as assessments were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
		- Writing teacher assessment and reading, writing and maths (combined) measures from 2018 onwards are not directly comparable to previous years due to changes in the writing teacher assessment frameworks.
		Some of this data has been aggregated and may show differences to other published figures. 
		
		
		
		### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format 
		This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). 
		For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'.
