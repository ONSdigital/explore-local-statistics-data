		### Source
		
		 - Northern Ireland: Department for the Economy (Northern Ireland) [Apprenticeships NI](https://www.economy-ni.gov.uk/publications/apprenticeshipsni-ad-hoc-tables), [Futher Education (FE) colleges and College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise (CAFRE)](https://www.economy-ni.gov.uk/publications/higher-level-apprenticeships-further-education-academic-year-202223) and [Higher Education Institutions](https://www.economy-ni.gov.uk/publications/higher-level-apprenticeship-higher-education-institutions-statistical-fact-sheet-202122) 
		
		
		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		- Starts refer to the number of participants who are in the first year of an apprenticeship programme. - Data relate to participants who have been on their course 28 days or more.
		 - Geography is based upon the home postcode of the learner.
		 - ApprenticeshipsNI includes levels 2 and 3.
		 - 
		 - Higher Level Apprenticeships (HLA) at further education (FE) colleges in Northern Ireland and the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise (CAFRE) includes levels 4, 5 and 6.
		 - HLA at Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Northern Ireland includes levels 6 and 7.
		 - [2022 mid-year population estimates for Northern Ireland](https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/2022-mid-year-population-estimates-northern-ireland) have been used to create a rate per 100,000 population.
		 - Figures produced by each UK nation may differ due to differing sources, time periods, age analysed or differences in methodologies so they are not directly comparable.
		
		
		
		### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format 
		This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). 
		For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. 
		For more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).
