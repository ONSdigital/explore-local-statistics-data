		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		The data presented only includes children participating in the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) in state maintained schools, any measurements taken at independent and special schools are excluded from the analysis.
		
		Children are classified as (centiles are of the British 1990 growth reference (UK90) according to age and sex):
		 - Underweight if their body mass index (BMI) is less than the 2nd centile.
		 - Healthy weight if their body mass index (BMI) is between the 2nd and less than the 85th centile.
		 - Overweight if their body mass index (BMI) is on or above the 85th centile, but less than the 95th centile.
		 - living with obesity if their body mass index (BMI) is on or above the 95th centile.
		
		The data source combines the City of London totals with Hackney, and the Isles of Scilly totals with Cornwall to prevent potential disclosure of individuals. Explore Local Statistics cannot visualise data for combined areas so please refer to the original data source for this data. 
		
		
		
		### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format 
		This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). 
		For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'.
