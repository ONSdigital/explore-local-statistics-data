		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		Carbon dioxide per capita emissions (tCO2e) refers to the average amount of carbon dioxide emissions produced by each person in a specific area over a year. This metric is calculated by dividing the total carbon dioxide emissions of a country by its population. The result is expressed in tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) per person.
		
		Emissions data is also visualised on [Local Authority Greenhouse Gas Map.](https://naei.energysecurity.gov.uk/laghgapp/)
		
		Emissions data is from UK local authority greenhouse gas emissions estimates where some emissions can't be fully allocated to individual local authorities for technical or disclosure reasons. 
		
		Some of this data has been aggregated and may show differences to other published figures.
