		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		Data about chain supermarkets in the UK is from the Geolytix Supermarket Retail Points project. This data is complemented by 52 stores from selected food retailers not in the Geolytix dataset. Per capita estimates are calculated using the usual resident population estimates from the most recent Census. These per capita estimates are not directly comparable between the different countries because of the non-consistent census dates that the population estimates were taken on.
		
		Some of this data has been aggregated and may show differences to other published figures.
