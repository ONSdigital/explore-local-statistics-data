		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		
		- Examples of physical arts engagement include reading, performing music, or going to a comedy event.  The full list of qualifying activities and events asked of respondents can be found in [Annex 3](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/participation-survey-2023-24-annual-publication/main-report-for-the-participation-survey-may-2023-to-march-2024#Arts) of the data source.
		
		- Physical engagement with the heritage sector is defined as visiting one of a variety of places with celebrated histories, such as those connected with industrial history, or ancient monuments, or archaeological sites.
		
		- Respondents were asked about their visits to museums and galleries in the 12 months prior to completing the survey.
		
		- Physical library engagement includes visiting a public library building or mobile library in-person during leisure time, being visited by a home library service and using another library outreach service (for example attending a community event where the library staff or volunteers were present).
		
		- Confidence intervals help show that differences between similarly ranked geographies may not be statistically significant.
		
		- The Participation Survey is asked of adults (16+) in England and the data has been weighted to compensate for differences in both sampling probability and response probability. Please see the [weighting methodology](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/participation-survey-2023-24-annual-publication/participation-survey-2023-to-2024-annual-technical-report#weighting) for further details.
