          - Description: This dataset shows publicly available electric vehicle charging devices at all speeds per 100,000 population (official statistics in development), in the UK, as of 00:00 on the first day of each quarter from October 2019 to April 2025.
		
		### Coverage

		### Source
		
		 - United Kingdom: [Department for Transport and Zapmap](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure-statistics) 
		
		
		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		- Data is provided by the electric vehicle and charging point platform [Zapmap](https://www.zapmap.com/) and represents devices reported as operational at 00:00 on the first day of each quarter.
		
		- ‘Total devices’ represent publicly available charging devices at all speeds. A device can have a number of connectors of varying speeds.
		
		- There may be large increases or reductions seen at local authority level in these statistics when comparing to a previous quarter and these should be considered in the context of longer-term trends. This can be caused by a number of factors, including a large group of devices being added to or decommissioned from source Zapmap data at a time. This can in turn be caused by delays between chargepoint operator activity and this information filtering through to Zapmap data.
		
		A specific example of this is Hammersmith and Fulham, which shows a sharp increase in mid-2023. This was due to the completion of a large On-Street Residential Chargepoint Scheme (ORCS) project, which significantly boosted the number of devices recorded in that area during that period.
		
		- The most recent population figures by Local Authority are sourced from the Office for National Statistics Population estimates for mid-year 2022. For quarters from July 2020 (2020-07) to April 2021 (2021-04), the population figures were sourced from 2019 estimates. Prior to July 2020 (2020-07), the population figures were sourced from the 2018 estimates.
