        - Comment: Percentage of pupils in state-funded primary, state funded secondary and special schools who have been eligible for free school meals in the past 6 years that were persistently absent (those absent for 10% of schooling sessions) during the academic year, England (state-funded schools), academic years 2017/18 - 2021/22.
        - Description: This dataset shows the percentage of pupils in state-funded primary, state funded secondary and special schools who have been eligible for free school meals in the past 6 years that were persistently absent (those absent for 10% of schooling sessions) during the academic year, in England (state-funded schools), for academic years 2017/18 - 2021/22.

		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		Only national and regional data are available for academic year 2017/18 and data is not available for academic year 2019/20.
		
		Persistent absence includes absence where a pupil had tested positive for COVID-19 (national isolation policies for people ill with COVID-19 were still in effect during this period). Consequently a large proportion of persistent absence and regional variation in persistent absence is due to differing regional spread of COVID-19 rather than pupil behaviour. 
		
		
		
		### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format 
		This dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). 
		For example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'.
