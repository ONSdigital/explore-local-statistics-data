		#### Geography definition
		
		Local Authority Districts and Unitary Authorities,
		Counties,
		Regions,
		Nations (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland),
		Countries (UK) 
		
		### Source
		
		 - United Kingdom: [Office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/bulletins/shorttermletsthroughonlinecollaborativeeconomyplatformsuk/previousreleases) 
		
		
		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		-Analysis uses data from online collaborative economy platforms Airbnb, Booking.com and Expedia Group. 
		
		-Average length of stay is calculated by dividing the number of nights by the number of stays. 
		
		-The data have a strong seasonal trend. Therefore, changes over time should generally be compared year-on-year, rather than month-on-month or quarter-on-quarter. 
		
		-While these statistics are believed to cover a large proportion of short-term lets activity in the UK, they do not cover all activity, as data from other providers and platforms are not included.
