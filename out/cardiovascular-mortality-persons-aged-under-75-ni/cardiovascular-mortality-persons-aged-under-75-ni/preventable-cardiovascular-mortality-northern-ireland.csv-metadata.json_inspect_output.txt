		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		- Data have been updated for years 2001 to 2022, and therefore cover the COVID-19 pandemic. The official population estimates for mid-2012 to mid-2020 have been revised, to incorporate the data now available from Census 2021. The data for this indicator has been revised to use the rebased population estimates from 2012 onwards. 
		- Rates presented are based on year of death registration, not year of occurrence.
