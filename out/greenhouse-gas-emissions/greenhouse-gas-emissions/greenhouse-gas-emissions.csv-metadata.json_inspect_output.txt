		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		Greenhouse gas emissions (tCO2e) per capita refers to the average amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by each person in a specific area over a year. This metric is calculated by dividing the total greenhouse gas emissions of an area by its population. The result is expressed in tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) per person.
		
		Greenhouse gas emissions here include territorial emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O).
		
		Emissions are reported against the areas where they occurred except for emissions associated with energy supply that are distributed to the areas based on where the 'end-use' of the energy occurred and emissions from waste that have been distributed based on the waste arising in each area.
		
		Emissions data is from UK local authority greenhouse gas emissions estimates where some emissions can't be fully allocated to individual local authorities for technical or disclosure reasons. 
		
		Some of this data has been aggregated and may show differences to other published figures.
		
		Emissions data is also visualised on [Local Authority Greenhouse Gas Map.](https://naei.energysecurity.gov.uk/laghgapp/)
