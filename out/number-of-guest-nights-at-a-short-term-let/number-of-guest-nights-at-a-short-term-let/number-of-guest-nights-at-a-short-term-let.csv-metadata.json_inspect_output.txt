		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		-Analysis uses data from online collaborative economy platforms Airbnb, Booking.com and Expedia Group. 
		
		-The number of nights spent during a stay, with a night counted per individual member of the visiting group. This can be influenced by guest group size and length of stay. For example, a family of four staying for 2 nights would be 8 guest nights. 
		
		-The data have a strong seasonal trend. Therefore, changes over time should generally be compared year-on-year, rather than month-on-month or quarter-on-quarter. 
		
		-While these statistics are believed to cover a large proportion of short-term lets activity in the UK, they do not cover all activity, as data from other providers and platforms are not included.
