		### Source Notes and Caveats 
		- These figures are based on meter level electricity consumption data.
		
		- Electricity consumption estimates for Great Britain cover the months February to January. For example, 2023 relates to the period February 2023 to January 2024. Electricity meters with a profile class of 1 or 2 are classified as domestic meters.
		
		-Electricity consumption estimates for Northern Ireland refer to financial years (1 April â€“ 31 March). For example, 2023 relates to the period 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. Northern Ireland local government district figures are only available from 2015 onwards. Electricity meters are classified as domestic meters based on their tariff type.
