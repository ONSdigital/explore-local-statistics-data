    "description": "This dataset shows the early years foundation stage profile outcomes of five year olds. Percentage at 'expected level' across all communication and language, literacy and mathematics early learning goals, in England (state-funded schools), for academic years 2021/22 to 2023/24.\n\n### Coverage \n\nEngland (state-funded schools)\n\n#### Geography definition\n\nLocal Authority Districts and Unitary Authorities,\nCounties,\nCombined Authorities,\nRegions,\nNation (England)\n\n### Source\n\n - England: [Department for Education](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/early-years-foundation-stage-profile-results) \n\n\n### Source Notes and Caveats \n- Early years foundation stage profile was revised significantly in September 2021. It is therefore not possible to directly compare assessment outcomes from 2021/22 onwards with earlier years. \n- Results are published by DfE and there are some differences between the results broken down by upper tier local authorities (based on the location of the submitting authority) and those by lower tier local authorities (based on the postcode of the school or provider). For more information, please refer to [Early years foundation stage profile results Methodology](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/methodology/early-years-foundation-stage-profile-results-methodology). \n- Some of this data has been aggregated and may show differences to other published figures. \n\n\n\n### How to read time intervals in ISO8601 format \nThis dataset uses custom time intervals format for periods, YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00/PnI, where P tells that this is period; n is the number of intervals and I is interval type which can be Y(year), M(month), W(week), D(day). \nFor example, from April 2019 to March 2022 is represented as 2019-04-01T00:00:00/P3Y, which can be read as '3 years period starts from 1st of April 2019 and ends on 31st March 2022'. \nFor more instructions on how to read this, please visit [Time intervals on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Time_intervals).",
